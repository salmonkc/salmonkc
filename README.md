I am a software engineer and have been developing web applications for almost 20 years. I am enthusiastic about building applications using web technologies. I enjoy being able to use my creative abilities to build software that can truly be a benefit to people. I also enjoy how the creation of software gives me the chance to work in a team with clients, designers, and other developers. This interaction is one of the best parts of any project I have been involved with. I believe my experience in building both back-end web services using PHP or Java, and front-end coding with HTML5, SASS and TypeScript would make me a good fit for this opportunity.
